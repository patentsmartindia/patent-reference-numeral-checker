## Patent Reference Numeral Checker

This tool tries to identify numbered parts from a patent or patent application.

This is useful to confirm that the author has not mixed up the reference numerals by including something like `the dashboard 10` and `the foobar 10`.

Enter your patent description on the left textarea and click Analyze. You will get the result on the right side.
